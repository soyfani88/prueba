Dear X,

My name is Estefanía León, I am a software developer at Sopra Steria working on GPCC project. I am writing
because we need to upgrade XAP Gigaspaces from version 10 to version 12. Apparently, it is mandatory
to upgrade to version 11 first and then to version 12, could you please confirm that? We would also
be grateful if you could provide some general guidelines on best practices to upgrade the software.
Any links to technical resources will be appreciated as well.

Thank you for your time and efforts.

Kind regards,

E. León.
